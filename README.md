# Issue Tracker

### [View the site here](https://davys-issue-tracker.herokuapp.com/) 

## Description
An application that allows a user to log in, create projects and keep track of issues.

Users can create their own account which will then display only the projects associated with that account. On each project, users can add issues, declare whether it is a bug/feature, delete/edit issues, and view completed issues.
The date/time that each issue was created and completed are automatically tracked as well.

Created using Python, Django, Bootstrap, and deployed on Heroku.
